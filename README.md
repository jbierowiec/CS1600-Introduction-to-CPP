# CS1600 Introduction to C++

## Introduction
The following homeworks and labs were developed during my sophomore year at Fordham University as my first undergraduate programming course. All of these assignments were developed in C++.

## Homeworks

1. CS Logo
- A very simple program outputting a logo with the letters C & S on the terminal.
2. Room Capacity
- A simple program using an if-else to determine if a meeting can take place based on the room capacity. 
3. Gross Pay
- A program that determines the gross pay of an employee dependent on the number of hours worked and the number of dependants.
4. Class Exercises
- A program that computes the average class exercise grade based on how many exercises are inputted, and what is the grade a student recieved based on each exercise.
5. Long Distance Phone Call
- A program that computes the price of a long distance phone call, dependent on what time of day and what type of day the call was made. 
6. Riddler Number
- A program that computes a riddled number based on a set of requirements for the number.
7. Jacket, Hat, and Waist Sizes
- A program that computes the jacket, hat and waist sizes after a user inputs their height, weight and age.
8. Compute Coins
- A program that computes the amount of change that can be returned to a user based on a monetary value initally inputted.

## Labs

1. Greetings
- A very simple program that outputs a message onto the screen.
2. Acceleration Calculator
- A program that computes the acceleration given a user input of initial velocity, final velocity and time.
3. Slope Calculator
- A program that computes the slope given a user input of a x1, x2, y1, and y2 value.
4. Bronx Book Store
- A program that computes the price of Cervantes, Homer or Shakespeare books, based on the amount the user wants to buy, prompts the user to enter a payment, and returns a receipt with how many books they bought, how much was paid for each, as well as the change computed from the user's payment input. 
5. Fordham Airlines
- A program that calculates the price of a flight to Chicago, Miami or Portland based on the time of day and type of day. The user would then be prompted to make a payment to which if the user pays a sufficient amount, the tickets will be ordered. If not, then no tickets will be ordered. 
6. Phone Pad
- A program that translates a phone number string that contains letters inputted instead of numbers to output the phone number string with just numbers based on the letter to digit conversion on the universal phone pad. 
7. Check Password
- A program that checks if a password is valid or not, based on the criteria of having at least one uppercase letter, being at least 10 characters long, having a number, and having a special characater. 
8. Letter Occurence
- A program that counts the occurence of letters on an inputted string.
